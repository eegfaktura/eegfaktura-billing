> Do the actual billing

This service is part of the eegfaktura software. This software allows renewable energy communities (EEGs)
to do the billing.

### Testing

Please note, that the current state of tests is not yet fine and is to be extended, cleaned-up a lot still.
The current tests ensures, that the most important billing use cases do work. It definitely a good idea

to define where the PDFs generated by the tests are stored.
